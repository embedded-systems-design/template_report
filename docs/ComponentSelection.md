## Summary Table of major components

| Component type | My pick |
|-----|-----------|
| Mircocontroller | PIC18F47Q10-E/MP |
| Voltage Regulation | NCV2575D2T-12R4G |
| Motor Driver | TMC5072 Stepper Motor Driver |
| Motor Stepper | NEMA 17 Stepper Motor |


## Decision Making Process

Main decision for picking the PIC was at the time, we only used the pic and I knew how to work it and was comfortable with it. If I were to do it over again I would use the PIC again. But add more output pins to see if everything was working correctly.

I chosose the voltage regulator I picked because it met all the product requirements. Switching regualator, 12 V to 3.3 V, surface mounted, and can hold 2 A. I would pick this one again, I had no problems with this. 

I picked the TMC5072 motor driver, it was an easy pick because it was able to have 2 motors and used SPI. All the research said this driver could support a fast motor. I would not pick this again, although I got it to receive SPI data, I couldnt get it to turn the motor. I beleive because it required 8 lines of commend to setup the motor, and the pic wasnt able to send it correctly. I would pick the in class motor driver and use 2 of them and try to run them at the same time. 

NEMA 17 is a great motor. I picked this one because it needed low current and was able to hold a wave movement. I would use this again. 

## Power Budget Conclusion

The Power budget showed that I needed 2 Amp to safety power the board, made it easy to find components for this because 2 is a whole number.

## Team Role and Responsibilities

My role as a member of this team is the **actuator**, using a **stepper motor** to create a waveform using a string. I am responsible for ensuring precise control of the motor to achieve the desired motion and vibration needed for sound generation. 

For **communication**, I use **SPI** to interface with the motor driver and **UART** to connect with my teammates' systems. I also contribute to **power management**, making sure the motor and driver receive a stable power supply. Additionally, I assist in **PCB design**, ensuring that all components are properly integrated and function efficiently within the overall system.

## Final Microcontroller Choice and Rationale

After careful consideration of multiple microcontroller options, the **PIC18F47Q10** has been chosen as the optimal microcontroller for this project. This decision is based on several key factors, including its **robust peripheral set, efficient power consumption, and strong software support**. The **PIC18F47Q10** provides essential features such as **multiple UART, SPI, and I2C channels**, making it well-suited for handling communication with both the motor driver and other system components. Additionally, it offers **flexible PWM outputs and timers**, which are crucial for precise stepper motor control. 

Another significant advantage is my **previous experience working with PIC microcontrollers**, which will expedite development and troubleshooting, allowing for a more efficient workflow. The **availability of extensive documentation and Microchipâ€™s development tools, including MPLAB X and MCC**, further strengthens this choice. The microcontroller's **low-cost, reliable performance, and easy integration into the PCB design** make it the best fit for our project. With this selection finalized, I will ensure that we acquire the necessary hardware promptly to stay on track with our development timeline.
