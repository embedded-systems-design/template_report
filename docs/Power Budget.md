Since the majority of the power is going to be utilized by the esp32, it is the only component on the 3.3V power line. Since this compnent only uses a max of 95mA out of the available 1000mA from the regulator, Current will not be an issue for my system. Eventually, the excess current will be utilized to power other boards via the daisy chain.
