## Hello! My name is Kirk Volin

I am a student as ASU Polytechnic pursuing a Bachelor's in Robotics Engineering

My subsystem for this project is the ESP32 with bidirectional internet communication over MQTT protocol.

This site is intended as a repository for my work in the EGR 314 project class taught be Professor Nichols in Spring 2025.

This is a work in progress and will be continually updated as we work on the project.
