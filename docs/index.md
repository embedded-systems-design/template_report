## Zack Gald Individual Website

Welcome to my individual project report for the "String Machine" developed for EGR314. This website provides an overview of my work, focusing specifically on the stepper motor system used to drive the vibrating strings to produce different human-pitch tones.

My name is Zack Gald, and I was responsible for the stepper motor subsystem, including motor selection, driver integration, and tuning for musical frequency generation. Our team collaborated closely to design and build a functional prototype, balancing mechanical, electrical, and software challenges.
