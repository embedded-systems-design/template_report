### Meeting Coordination

Meetings will typically be held during *chosen hours* and are preferably in-person. If circumstances do not allow for a normal meeting time, a more suitable meeting time should be discussed and agreed upon. Meeting schedule will be kept in *personal or group* calendar for reminders. For more spontaneous meetings, members may not be required to attend if personal reasons arise.

### Roles & Responsibilities

Name | Role | Duties
*name* | Meeting Leader    | Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting
*name* | Meeting Recorder  | Takes minutes of each team meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned
*name* | Assignment Leader | Coordinates the team's work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date
Ian Anderson | Project Monitor   | Tracks the team's progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt Chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status
*Assigned roles are subject to change at any time*

### Team Coordination & Accountability

### Conflict Recognition & Resolution

Our team understands that disagreements will happen in group environments. As such, members are expected to be able to handle conflicts in a mature and civil way. Additional meetings may be arranged upon failure to complete responsibilities, and repeated behavior will be escalated to professors.
